## Pymaceuticals Anti-Cancer Medications Analysis
Introduction
In this assignment, we analyze a real-world dataset from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The dataset consists of the results of an animal study where different drug regimens were tested for their effectiveness in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a form of skin cancer.

## Background
Pymaceuticals conducted a study on 249 mice with SCC tumors, testing various drug regimens over a 45-day period. The primary focus was on comparing the performance of Capomulin, one of Pymaceuticals' drugs of interest, against other treatment regimens.

## Tasks Overview
Prepare the Data: Merge datasets, handle duplicates, and create a clean DataFrame.
Generate Summary Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for tumor volume by drug regimen.
Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Visualize data using bar and pie charts.
Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: Analyze final tumor volumes and detect outliers.
Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot: Visualize tumor volume over time and weight versus tumor volume.
Calculate Correlation and Regression: Determine the relationship between weight and tumor volume.
